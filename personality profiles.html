	My thoughts:
</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	When I approach a problem I like to think about all the variables,
	the possible solutions and the possible repercussions or results of implementing those solutions.
	I’ve taken personality tests before at different points in my life, with some being more honest with
	myself than others and some giving more favorable (or what I saw as favorable) results. I don’t believe a
	persons Personality is entirely set in stone. I think it can change through-out a persons life and for a
	variety of reasons; A change in circumstances, new friends or partner, a new job or a sudden loss can all
	have an affect. For me, personalities are an entirely fluid thing but yet some aspects cannot be entirely altered.
<p>
<!--Section 1-->

<h4 style="font-family: Arial">
	The Meyers-Briggs Test
</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	At this point in my life, I feel that a result of “Advocate” is
	perhaps the closest I have seen to align with both how I see myself and how the world potentially
	sees me. Meyers-Briggs defines an Advocate as “someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling,
	and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination.
	Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.”[1,1].
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	On first read I picked out “Judging” as a negative trait due to its connotations, but on further reading I realised
	that it is who I am and how I tend to operate. Often times I have redundancies in mind, plans upon plans and that
 	I do prefer to think ahead to reach a solution. I can be creative with these solutions and often prefer to think
 	outside the box for a less orthodox approach to a solution than others might. I care deeply for those I work with
 	and for and place their wellbeing above my own, I try to create a positive work environment in those around me and
  encourage others to be their best selves. I often find myself thinking of others first when approaching a problem
	or reflect greatly on how a solution may impact others rather than myself.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	I believe my ideal job fits this personality test result perfectly. An Advocate often see’s their purpose in life
	to help those around them, more altruistic, more focused on fixing the deeper underlying issues to help others and
	the world around them. As such, a role withing DWELP would mean that I can help the environment, those that live
	within it and come up with both practical and creative solutions to do so. Liaising with the various leaders in
	Industry and the community would allow me to take a front seat in approaching issues than run much deeper in our
	society than how a company can maximise profit. Finding a sense of purpose in my work is something I constantly
	strive and look for, something which is lacking in my current career, something which a career as a Business Analyst
 could help solve.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	However, there are drawbacks. I can tend to get stuck in my ways when it comes to a plan. All the redundancies
	in the world don’t allow for the chaos factor and I can struggle to adjust when things do not go to plan. My
	intuitive personality type means that I can get lost in looking to far forwards and looking too deeply into
	something. I may spend too long looking into a problem, diving in too deep too quickly before realising there is
 	a simpler solution. The “Feeling” trait lends itself towards being a concerned and constructive team member
 	but also means I can become too highly invested in an individuals well-being, avoiding solutions that may negatively
 	impact them or a greater concern.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Finally, “Introverted” is not something I see either one way or the other. It is the one constant in most
	personality tests I have taken. I think it does conflict at times with my desire to lead, but it also allows
	me time for introspection and to look at problems more deeply or differently than others.

	RMIT Personal Learning Profile
</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	I took the RMIT Personal Learning Profile (PLP) as part of my RMIT orientation and
	onboarding. The results surprise me when I look back at them now as the test lists “Using Technology” as a focus
	area. While technology plays an important role in my life on a daily basis, When doing the test I was concerned
	about my ability to use a solely online platform for Education. Over the last few weeks I have become more and more
	familiar with using Canvas as an educational tool and now feel more comfortable using it to its fullest extent.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Another focus area the test highlighted was Personal Value. In the past I have struggled
	with University, picking the wrong degree or feeling forced to choose a career so early in life. As such, I struggle
	to feel like I can achieve academically at a University level. It is not because I do not see the actual value in what
	I may study, it is because I have found that in the past I have not really planned where I see the degree taking me to.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Two Strengths listed in the results are Persistence and Accessing Support. I’ve learnt
	over my life that it is important to ask for help when you need it, there is always somebody that knows more than you
	and I see it as a great strength of character to be able to seek advice or help when you need it. Persistence is
	something I also learnt from an early age. While I may have faltered in my previous attempt at tertiary study, I always
	felt it was because work life got in the way, or I stopped enjoying my course. I persisted in my career and came to
	own my own business which has now put me in a position to be able to further my studies. I now have the motivation
	and drive to continue along this path.

<h4 style="font-family: Arial">
	The Situational Judgement Test
</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	The Situational Judgement test is one that some potential workplaces may require I take, whether it be formally or
	informally by way of specially worded interview questions. The test is designed to assess a person’s ability to choose
	the most appropriate course of action in a given workplace situation, mainly aimed at handling behavioral or team
	orientated situations.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	In my test I answered 11 out of 16 questions correctly. I found that my incorrect answers were often based around what
	the test termed “Least Effective responses”, while in all but two answers I selected the “Most Effective” reaction. To
  me, this indicates that I can implement the most effective response and solution to a given situation in all but a few
  situations.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	The two incorrect answers to “Most Effective” reaction were in response to situations that I felt would have made team
	members feel uncomfortable or would have only been paying lip service to an issue. In one of these instances, I elected
	to meet with the team members in an informal chat setting to discuss the issues rather than meet with team leaders
  individually to hear their concerns. For me, a team-based discussion allows for better collaboration and a more refined
  team plan. However, I do see the benefits of a formal 1-on-1 meeting with team leaders to discuss their issues. After
  which I would meet with all team leaders together to discuss how we can best implement their ideas to create a better
  team environment and move forward.

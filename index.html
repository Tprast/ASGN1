	I know what you're thinking, a whole website devoted to one person that
	isn't even famous? Well.. it's more than that. This website is an expression of
	me, my skills in and knowledge of IT. Have a browse, get to know me and feel free
	to get in contact if you want to chat all things IT or about my IT Project

<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Hello world, My name is Tim Prast. I am 30 years old and was born and raised in Perth, Western Australia.
	In this website I am going give you, the reader, a bit of background about myself and then we are going to
	explore my interest in IT, when and how it began, why it hasn’t seemed to go away and what makes me Tick.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Some might call Perth the most isolated capitol city in the world, and while in a sense I’d have to agree based
	on its geographical nature, But the growth of the Internet and Technology has meant it doesn’t have to feel that
	way. Growing up in Perth pre the true implementation of the internet afforded me a relatively sheltered up-bringing.
	My brother and I would run around in the gardens, roam the streets or kick the football at the park and so long as
	we returned before it was dark all was well. I wasn’t exposed to the thing’s kids are these days with the easy
	access to the Internet (targeted ads, Screen parenting, social media). I’d call my friends on the landline or ride my bike
	to their house if I wanted to see them, times seemed simpler and the world seemed smaller, but nostalgia has that effect.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	I don’t remember the exact day itself, but I have very vivid memories of my Uncle bringing over an IBM desktop
	computer that ran on a MS-DOS operating system. I was too young to really use the system by myself at the time,
	but I would spend hours watching my Brother play games like Commander Keen and playing with the floppy discs
	themselves. Eventually the DOS system was replaced by a windows desktop and the use of computers became more
	commonplace in school. As I went through my schooling, more and more homework was done on the home computer.
	We went from handwriting essays and reports to typing them out on Word or running a presentation on PowerPoint
	and digitally submitting them. I often feel like I grew up alongside computers, each year new software or
	hardware came out and it felt like technology was growing and advancing to suit my needs. Gone was having to
	go to the library to find Encyclopedias because there was this new thing called Google that can give you all
	the information in the world simply by typing in a search query.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Mobile phones, Social Media and YouTube crashed into me like a wave. All of a sudden, I could be in instant
	contact with all of my friends. Mobile Phones couldn’t run as many apps as they can nowadays nor were they
	so dominated with the social media apps of today, we had to rely on the good old Text Message. Myspace was
	dominating the market and online chat programs were the thing to use on Desktop. I still remember sitting in
	an Audio/Visual Media class one day and some friends showing me a website called YouTube, here was this
	platform where I could watch videos on just about anything, all online and all for free.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Gaming has also been a large part of my life. Whether it be the first Nintendo 64 my family had or the
	multiple gaming PC’s I’ve built over the years. I have very vivid memories of using the dial-up connection
	to look up gaming guides for Ocarina of Time, even nowadays I still use the same websites when I get stuck
	in a section of a game. Building my very first gaming PC was a big step for me, I spent hours researching
	components and making sure everything would work and fit together, researching what components did and how
	they worked, what was required for it to run and turn on, how to plug everything in and connect it all up.
	The first time I powered the PC up and everything ran smoothly was both a huge relief and a feeling I still
	hold dear to this day. Gaming continues to play a role in my life by connecting me with distant friends and a
	source of much needed stress relief in the busy adult world.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Nostalgia aside, I’ve spent the last 12 years, after gradutating highschool, creating a career within the
	hospitality industry. I have owned and operated my own Small bar in Subiaco for the last 5 years and I couldn’t
	do anywhere near as many of the things I can that help me run that business without technology. I’ve seen things go from Point of
	Sale (PoS) systems with a Clunky user Interface to the smooth heavily stylised things they are now. Our PoS is
	entirely cloud based and runs from a web browser on small mini pc’s using touchscreen monitors to interface with
	the user. Menus are available on the website (which I built using Squarespace and did all the Domain registering
	and connecting myself) and customers can follow us on social media to see pictures of food items, daily specials,
	upcoming events or even just connect with us before deciding to visit the venue itself.
	On back-end side of things, our payroll, rostering, stock ordering and accounting is all done with the use of
	technology. From cloud based accounting software to share-able Google Sheets and even apps that staff can use to
	track their hours. Nothing in the modern business world is untouched or unchanged by technology.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	I chose to go to RMIT because it has a great reputation, and its campus location fits nicely with my
	future plans to relocate to Melbourne early in 2022. I’ve been looking at making a career change for
	the last few years as after 12 years working in Hospitality the hours are beginning to become too much.
	 My interest in IT meant that a degree in IT, with a hopefully transfer to Computer Science once I arrive
	 in Melbourne, was a natural fit for me. I get to learn more about IT and Technology and then develop my
	 skills enough to pursue a career in it.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	For me, Technology has always been there. Always advancing, always changing but always there. I feel like I’ve
	grown up with it. The phone in my pocket has at least a thousand times the operating power of that first IBM
	Desktop and links seamlessly with my life. It’s no longer a cumbersome box that sits on a desk draped in cables
	and wires, it fits in my palm and connects me to the larger world. This, for me, is Information Technology.
	It is the way technology can help us to integrate with, connect to and interact with the larger (and sometimes smaller) world around us.

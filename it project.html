	IT Project & Stock-Take-IT:
</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	One problem I constantly run into in my business is accurately and efficiently doing a
	stock-take. The venue, albeit small, has plenty of storage areas for inventory which
	are not confined to one area and relies on either staff or myself to be able to efficiently
	and accurately count inventory. I have used apps and software in the past to help speed up
	this process but often find they are not intuitive enough, require too much set-up time or
	do not play nicely with our current PoS and back of house systems. For this project, I have
	decided to investigate the issue and come up with a proposed solution that could (if
	practical to create) be implemented in the business and have a real and tangible result on
	workflow, efficiency and inventory management. This project and its investigation also allows
	me to develop my skills in IT and work towards a future career as a Business Analyst, By looking
	 at a problem in my own business and then working towards and planning out a solution.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	The result of this thought process is “Stock-Take-IT”.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Stock-Take-IT will be a one stop shop for stock taking and inventory management with a
	strong focus on and high marketability towards the hospitality sector.

Stock-Take-IT:
</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	The focus of Stock-Take-IT will be on delivering a high quality mobile App for both
	iOS and Android systems with back end functionality for a range of cloud based PoS
	systems and inventory management suites. A key part of Stock-Take-IT is on the user
	experience, with a simple and easy to use UI. The App will allow the user to download
	the App to their phone or tablet and;

<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Stock-Take-IT isn’t revolutionary by nature and while there are a number of different Stocktaking
	Apps and Software packages out on the market, it’s simplistic functionality and design are sure to
	be a winner. By not bloating the App with the QR, Bluetooth or barcode scanning technology aimed at
	larger warehouse facilities we avoid the larger competition space. This allows us to focus marketing
	on the key demographic, Hospitality Venues, and tailor the App to suit the key issues and problems
	facing the industry. A large percentage of Hospitality staff are Young, Casual or Part-time and low-skilled.
	By making the App as simple to use as possible, giving the user the power to simply input a product name or
	location and see the units required for counting we can cut down on the searching and manual input nature of
	Stock Taking and mitigate the risk of error.

	Execution
</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	In order to execute “Stock-Take-IT”, I will have to develop a large number of skills,

<!--Summary and conclusions-->
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Initially, I would plan to develop the App for Android systems.
	Fine-tuning the design, architecture and execution as I go along. A first plan phase would
	be required to map out the functionality key points and how to achieve them in real programming
	terms with the associated key skills required. Once a First plan phase is established, I can
	work towards a roll-out map for the App, which functionalities to focus on for initial testing,
	which aspects are key to the underlying use of the App. The First plan Phase and roll-out map
	are what I would pursue into Assignment 3 whilst attempting to build out an architecture plan –
	Which technologies and skills are required to make each specific functionality achieve the desired
	result and then built a mock-up of the App using the MIT app inventor tools.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	For me, this project aligns incredibly well with where I’d like
	my career to go. It fits with my current career and experience, it highlights what I see as a
	problem within my own business, and then allows me to flex my Business Analyst muscle and try
	and find a solution to said problem. It allows me to grow and develop my IT skills in a more
	practical way that will fit with my planned career progression by starting at the base level of
	designing and creating an IT focused solution to a problem and then by implementing the solution
	in a real and tangible way. As I’ve mentioned previously, while there are already Apps and Software
	packages in place that attempt to solve this problem, I believe none really target the Hospitality
	sector itself. This project is about combining my current career and my planned future career and
	being able to meld the two into one.

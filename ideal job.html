	My Future Career and Plans
</h4>
<!--Paragraphs begin here-->
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	Something you may have guessed from my home page is that I have a passion for the way IT can
	integrate into a Business and deliver tangible results. I am constantly looking for ways to
	improve My business’s workflow, streamline processes, increase efficiency and reduce back-end
	work hours. This is all very achievable when you can apply the right technology to the right
	task or process, as such, my ideal career in IT would be to work as a Business Analyst.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	A Business Analyst helps a more traditional business bridge the gap and find a more modern IT
	focused solution to suit their needs. A Business Analyst’s key role is to meet with a Business
	or End Product User and understand what a system does, how it does it and who it does it for.
	That information is then used to establish a set of requirements that need to be met, facilitate
	those requirements being met (pricing, validating, compromising) and use technology and hard data
	to do so. The role requires a person be able to problem solve and communicate effectively but also
	think analytically and critically. More technical skills are required when creating solutions and
	thinking critically and analytically about a problem. With a strong knowledge of the technical
	aspect of both the problem and the solution, a Business Analyst is able to communicate effectively
	with the client about their needs and provide the needed support and recommendations when it comes
	to providing a solution.

	The Role
</h3>
<h5 style="font-family: Arial">
	Business Analyst for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning
</h5>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	I have included a screen shot of what I believe to be my ideal job. The job itself is with the
	Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. The DELWP is a department that
	melds with and facilitates conversations between (and about) the Environment, the Community,
	Industry and the Economy. The DELWP aligns strongly with my personal opinions on the Environment
	and Climate Change and providing for a robust and biodiverse world for us to live in while encouraging
	a team based and inclusive work environment.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	The role is within a smaller branch of the DELWP, the Forest, Fire and Regions (FFR) team, and
	“Supports the design, development, documentation and implementation of data collection, integration,
	business intelligence and data analytics solutions and technologies” [1,1]. The advertisement lists
	the essential requirements as:
</p>
<!--Ordered List insert here, numbered list-->
<ol style="font-family: Arial">
	<li> Demonstrated business analysis experience, with knowledge and experience of data modelling and data management
		systems implementation.  [5,1]</li>
	<li> A thorough understanding of the principles of information technology including SQL Databases, Software Development
		Life Cycle, Agile processes,
			Web applications and web services. [5,1]</li>
	<li> Outstanding verbal and written communications skills. [5,1]</li>
	<li>Demonstrated high level stakeholder management skills. [5,1]</li>
</ol>
<!--Eye break and code seperating comment-->
<p style="font-family: Arial">
Knowledge and understanding of the below are key requirements for the role;
</p>
<!--Unordered List insert here, Bullet points-->
<ul style="font-family: Arial">
	<li>Data Modelling</li>
	<li>Data management systems and their implementation</li>
  <li>SQL Databases</li>
	<li>Software development life cycle</li>
	<li>Agile Processes</li>
	<li>Web Applications and Web Services</li>
	<li>Written Communication skills</li>
</ul>
<!--Text continues here-->
<p style="font-family: Arial">
	These are all part of my Degree in IT, if not, Supplementary courses can be taken (Both online and through
	specialty schools) to further my knowledge in specific areas such as SQL Databases. I aim to gain an overarching
	understanding of IT as a whole during my time at university which will place me in a good position to develop on
	the job specific software or hardware skills as I go through-out my career in IT. Experience in IT unfortunately
	only comes in time, so while this may be my ideal job, it is not something attainable straight out of
	university, this however gives me a long term goal to work towards. I believe I already have strong interpersonal
	skills, written and verbal communication skills, practical business acumen (implementing IT focussed solutions to
	business problems) and an understanding of good business practice so these will put me in a good position when future
	(but more junior) roles require business experience and strong communication skills.
